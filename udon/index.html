                        <p>Udon are chewy Japanese noodles made from wheat flour, water, and salt, typically served as a noodle soup in a hot dashi-based broth or served in a hot/cold sauce. 
                           They’re thicker than buckwheat soba noodles—typically 2-4 mm—and can be either flat or rounded.</p>

                        <p>When eating udon, it's common to use chopsticks to lift the noodles. 
                           It's also acceptable to make noise (via slurping) while eating in Japanese culture, as it's believed to enhance the flavors and cool down the hot noodles.
                           As mentioned earlier, there are 2 main ways to enjoy udon noodles: either in a warm broth or with a cold/hot sauce. 
                           There is a wide variety of toppings you can add to elevate your udon experience, such as seaweed, scallions, beef, etc.</p>

                    <h2><span>History</span> of Udon</h2>
                    <p>The earliest iteration of udon noodles likely originated in China and was introduced to Japan during the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). 
                       Legend says Kukai, a monk from present-day Kagawa Prefecture, who went to China as a research scholar transported udon back to Japan. 
                       Located in the small town of Ayagawa on Shikoku Island, Takinomiya shrine is believed to be the birthplace of udon, which has a stone relic marking where the first udon was made. 
                       Kukai taught his nephew Chisen the recipe he learned in China and it is said the family ate udon at this shrine. 
                       Back then, the original udon may have been closer to a dumpling (flattened round dough) than a noodle, and in some parts of Japan, udon is still cut into squares rather than the long strands that became standard by the early fourteenth century.
                    </p>
                    <p>Traditionally made at home, udon began to be sold in specialty stalls after the popularity of commercial in the seventeenth century. 
                       People kneaded flour, rolled dough, and cut noodles in the same process as we see today.
                       Some udon shops that date back to the Edo period continue to operate today.
                       One udon shop, in particular, stands out as a 400-year-old business located in a preserved traditional Japanese inn. 
                       Today, udon is eaten throughout Japan but especially in the south, from Osaka to Kyushu.
                       Its popularity within Japan has quickly spread across the world today and many people in other countries are able to enjoy this delicacy.

                    <h2><span>Regional</span> Udon Noodles Type</h2>
                    <p>Most people are already familiar with the thick sanuki-style udon as it’s the “default” udon served in Japanese restaurants. 
                       However, udon exists in a wide variety of forms and shapes, and many regions in Japan have their own spin. 
                       Here are 11 regional types of udon that are especially popular.
                    </p>
                    <p>1. Himokawa udon – Gunma
                       Traditionally made in Kiryū, a historic mountain city located in Gunma Prefecture, himokawa udon is a type of flat and thin wheat noodle. 
                       The width of himokawa udon differs from restaurant to restaurant, and it’s not uncommon to find ones that are up to 15cm in width.                         
                       As the dough is rolled out to a thin sheet, the noodles are much more delicate in texture compared to the chewy sanuki udon. 
                       Himokawa udon can be enjoyed hot or cold, though it is more difficult to slurp compared to ramen due to its sheer width.
                    </p>
                    <p>2. Musashino udon – Tokyo/ Saitama
                       Musashino udon is a type of udon that originated from the Musashino Plateau, a region that stretches from the Tama area in north-west Tokyo to part of Saitama Prefecture. 
                       Since there are no large rivers in the area, local agriculture is centred on the production of wheat and barley, which require less water to grow compared to rice. 
                       Over time, it became customary to make udon with locally grown wheat flour. 
                       Due to the addition of local wheat, musashino udon is characterised by its slight brown colour, as opposed to the pristine white of ordinary udon noodles. 
                       Though distinctly chewy like conventional sanuki-style udon, the musashino variant also has a slightly rough texture.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Mimi udon – Tochigi
                       Shaped like ears, mimi udon is a traditional food that has been passed down from generation to generation in the Senba area of Sano City. 
                       Though the dish was intended to be preserved food for the new year, it gradually became synonymous with auspiciousness. 
                       Now a customary dish enjoyed by locals on New Year’s Day, mimi udon is usually served in soya sauce-based broth.
                    </p>
                    <p>4. Hippari udon – Yamagata
                       Hippari udon (ひっぱりうどん) is a regional dish that has its roots in Yamagata Prefecture. 
                       During winter season, dried udon noodles and canned food are common kitchen staples. 
                       Dried noodles are boiled and pulled from a pot, then served in individual bowls of dipping sauce made from natto or canned mackerel. 
                       As one can easily prepare a hot meal without having to brave the cold while grocery shopping, hippari udon became a popular meal during colder months.
                    </p>
                    <p>5. Inaniwa udon – Akita 
                       Boasting a history of over 350 years, inaniwa udon is 1 of the 3 most well-known types of udon noodles in Japan. 
                       Commonly available in its dried form, inaniwa udon can be identified by its cream colour and distinctive thin strands. 
                       The raw wheat dough typically goes through a lengthy process of kneading, stretching, twisting, and flattening. 
                       Once it’s shaped into thin strands, the noodles are then aged for a period of time. 
                       The air bubbles incorporated into the dough during the production stage allows it to have a smooth texture and light mouthfeel.
                    </p>
                    <p>6. Gōsetsu udon – Hokkaido
                       Gōsetsu udon is made from potato starch instead of wheat flour. 
                       Originating from the small town of Kutchan, a major potato-producing region in Hokkaido, gōsetsu udon is chewier than your average udon noodle and has a unique texture. 
                       The udon variant is named gōsetsu (heavy snow) as Kutchan experiences one of the heaviest snowfalls in Hokkaido, accumulating to nearly 2m in height each year. 
                       Its translucent appearance is also likened to fresh snow.
                    </p> 
                    <p>7. Ise udon – Mie
                       Ise udon is unique to Ise City of Mie Prefecture and known for its distinctive chewiness. 
                       Extra-thick udon noodles around 1cm in diameter are boiled longer than usual, making them tender and soft.  
                       Ideally, the exterior of the udon noodles should be slightly mushy while the middle should retain a bit of chewiness and integrity. 
                       The soft udon noodles are doused in an umami-filled dark sauce that’s made with tamari soya sauce, then topped with sliced green onions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>8. Kishimen – Aichi 
                       Kishimen is a flat udon noodle that has been the soul food of Aichi Prefecture – especially Nagoya – since the Edo Period. 
                       With a thickness of 1mm and width of up to 8mm, kishimen is characterised by being wider and thinner than ordinary udon noodles.  
                       Its shape is said to be instrumental in its popularity. 
                       Locals swear by the flat noodle as it is supposedly better able to absorb the flavours of the broth. 
                    </p>                        
                    <p>9. Kinchaku kitsune udon – Nara 
                       Kinchaku kitsune udon takes wheat noodles and encases them in a pocket of fried tofu. 
                       The dish was invented in Nara prefecture in 2006 and is now a must-have local speciality for anyone visiting the area. 
                       Filled to the brim with udon noodles, the aburaage is tied with a string of long green onion. 
                       The tofu bag, which resembles a drawstring pouch, is served with warm dashi broth. 
                       To consume, use your chopsticks to tear open the aburaage and reveal the udon noodles hidden within.
                    </p>
                    <p>10. Naruchuru udon – Tokushima
                       Naruchuru udon is a type of thin noodle commonly eaten in Naruto, a coastal city in Tokushima Prefecture. 
                       As it is handmade, naruchuru udon is characterised by its uneven thickness and length. 
                       The noodles are served in a light golden broth that’s sweeter than the dashi broth you’d find in most udon dishes. 
                       Simple toppings such as sliced aburaage, chikuwa (fish cakes), and fresh green onions are local favourites.
                    </p>
                    <p>11. Gotō udon – Nagasaki 
                       Though it’s thin, gotō udon is known for its strong elasticity. 
                       Originating from the Gotō Islands in Nagasaki Prefecture, the regional speciality is considered 1 of the 3 best udon noodles in Japan. 
                       However, it’s not as well-known as its counterparts, the sanuki and inaniwa udon.
                       In Gotō, the udon noodles are traditionally enjoyed through jigoku-daki, a process where the noodles are cooked in pots of boiling water and served straight.
